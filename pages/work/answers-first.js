                        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
                        <p>
                            More than anything, what our users want is not an
                            additional metric, or new type of graph. What they
                            want are real answers to business questions. Now, in
                            order to answer those questions, we had work to do.
                            We needed a broader array of analysis tools in the
                            application, and we needed new ways to draw
                            connections between our analysis outputs and our
                            users&apos; business goals.

                        <h3>How did we approach this design?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The solution I proposed is called &quot;Answers
                            First&quot;. We would lean into our
                            technology&apos;s strength, producing meaningful
                            results within minutes from thousands or
                            tens-of-thousands or even hundres of thousands of
                            documents. We would build a new project view called
                            <Link href="/work/highlights">Highlights</Link>
                            that would present high-level insights (This is
                            where you get &quot;Answers First&quot;), then we
                            would guide users to our more in-depth tools to
                            build off of these foundational discoveries.

                            analysis features and a

                            helpful to new users and has reduced our reliance on
                            custom scripts and additional training sessions.
                            Over time, we hope to introduce further
                            customization, over-time views and sharing and
                            export options.
